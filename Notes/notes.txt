In this code:

GenerateApiKey creates a new API key using a GUID.

GenerateSalt creates a new salt using a cryptographically secure random number generator.

GenerateSaltedHash appends the salt to the API key and hashes the result using the SHA256 algorithm.

The Main method simulates the generation and verification of an API key.

When you run this program, it will output the API key, the salt, the salted hash of the API key, 
and whether the incoming API key (which is identical to the original API key in this case) is valid. 

In a real-world application, you'd store the salted hash and the salt in your database, 
and the API key would be provided by the client making the API request.
